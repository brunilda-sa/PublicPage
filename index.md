# 1. Introduction
> I have a Bachelor's Degree in electrical engineering and several years of professional experience in this field. Being someone that likes to learn, solve problems and analyse information I have enrolled myself into a Bootcamp at BrainStation to pursue a Data Scientist certificate. In this context, I intend to continously work in differents Data Scientist projects in order to build a portfolio that will show my skills and interests in the domain.
> In this page you will find a high level introduction to each project as well as some links to the projects results and notebooks.
