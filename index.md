# 1. Introduction
I have a Bachelor's Degree in electrical engineer and several years of professional experience in this field. Having the interest in learning and solving problems, I enrolled myself into a Bootcamp at BrainStation to pursue a Data Scientist certificate. In this context, I intend to continously work in differents Data Scientist projects in order to build a portfolio that will show my skills and interests in the domain.
In this page you will find a high level introduction to each project as well as some links to the project results and notebooks. The table of contents below will allow you to navigate from section to section.
