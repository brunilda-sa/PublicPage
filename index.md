# MultiLabel Classification for satellite images
## Project Description
> On this project the goal is to build a multi-label classification model, where given a specific satellite image the model will associate all labels belonging to it. The labels associated to the satellite images describe differents atmospheric conditions and various classes of land cover/land use.

> There are 17 possible labels: agriculture, artisinal_mine, bare_ground, blooming, blow_down, clear, cloudy, conventional_mine, cultivation, habitation, haze, partly_cloudy, primary, road, selective_logging, slash_burn, water.
In order to find the best model, I propose three approaches. All details, data regarding the project can be find in the links below:
